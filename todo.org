* Features, fixes

  - wrap calendar description lines in the article buffer

  - In Gnus I can't see that I have Accepted/Tentative'd/Declined an
    invitation. This would be nice to display - maybe by adding a custom
    header? Also the A'nswered mark could be set?

    Not sure about the headers and summary buffer. But as long as the
    information is kept in the org entry, it is possible to show this in the
    article buffer.

  - When finding an event in org, we should consider all org files to allow
    for events to be refiled
